Challenge 13:

A company calculates holiday allowance for employees.

The company gives each employees 28 days holiday each year. Holidays are awarded based on the following rules:

1. Full time employees who work 5 days a week get 28 days holiday a year

2. Part time employees get a proportion of holiday allowance based on how many days they work, e.g. An employee who works 1 day a week would only get 1/5th of the holidays allowed.
